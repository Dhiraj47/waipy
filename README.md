Installation
============

A local install can be done using the provided setup.py file:

    python setup.py install

The installation path can be changed using the **--prefix** switch, e.g.:

    python setup.py install --prefix $HOME/inst

Make sure to add the corresponding paths to your ``$PATH`` and ``$PYTHONPATH``
environment variables. Alternatively, if the **--user** switch can be used:

    export PYTHONUSERBASE=$HOME/inst/pip_installs
    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/inst/pip_installs/lib/python2.7/\
        site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH
    export PATH=$HOME/inst/pip_installs/bin:$PATH
    python setup.py install --user

If you plan on modifying the code, use the **develop** target in combination
with the **--user** swich:

    export PYTHONUSERBASE=$HOME/inst/pip_installs
    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/inst/pip_installs/lib/python2.7/\
        site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH
    export PATH=$HOME/inst/pip_installs/bin:$PATH
    python setup.py develop --user

The first three lines should also be included in the **$HOME/.bashrc** file.

The following packages are required (tested on Debian Wheezy):

* python-matplotlib
